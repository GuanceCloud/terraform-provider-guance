# Pipeline

Pipeline is a data processing language that Observability Cloud provides. Pipeline supports text parsing of different
formats of log data.

By writing a pipeline script, you can customize the structure of the log and use the cut fields as attributes.

By cutting out the attribute fields, we can quickly filter the relevant logs and perform data association analysis to help us quickly locate and solve problems.
