  Black List
  Guance Cloud supports filtering data that meets the conditions by setting a blacklist.
  After configuring the blacklist, the data that meets the conditions will no longer be reported to the Guance Cloud
  workspace, helping you save data storage costs.
  Example Usage
  ```terraform
  resource "guance_blacklist" "demo" {
    type   = "logging"
    source = "mysql"
  filters = [
      {
        name      = "foo1"
        operation = "in"
        condition = "and"
        values    = ["oac-*"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
