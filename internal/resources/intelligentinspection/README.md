Intelligent inspection is a feature that allows you to automatically detect abnormality in the system and trigger alarms. It is based on the concept of anomaly detection, which is a time series analysis technique that can detect anomalies in the system based on historical data.

Guance Cloud supports custom intelligent inspection through Function.
