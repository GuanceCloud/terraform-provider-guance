Workspace is a logical unit that contains all the resources of the Observability system. It is used to isolate the resources of different users and different projects. The resources of the same workspace can be shared with each other, and the resources of different workspaces cannot be shared.

Users can join one or more workspaces by creating or inviting. In the workspace, users can use the observability services provided by the Guance Cloud.

Notes:

1. The billing method of the workspace only supports changing once a month.
